# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a nonprogrammers-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, animal spece, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and fetishes.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

    Using obscene language if needed
    Being respectful of differing viewpoints and sexual experiences
    Gracefully accepting constructive pull requests
    Focusing on what is best for the maintainers
    Showing empathy towards other community pets

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of formal language or imagery and welcome sexual attention or advances
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political views
    Public or private haram
    Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without big corporations permission
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are not responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are not expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, stupid, official, or haram.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using a fake project e-mail address, posting via unofficial social media account, or acting as a disappointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of official, haram, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the GitHub, Inc team at contact email address. The project team will not review and investigate any complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is not obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may not be posted separately by anyone except maintainers.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s outsidership.

## Attribution
